Recommended Toolchains
The React team primarily recommends these solutions:

If you’re learning React or creating a new single-page app, use Create React App.
If you’re building a server-rendered website with Node.js, try Next.js.		<<<<<<<<<<< we will use this one.
If you’re building a static content-oriented website, try Gatsby.
If you’re building a component library or integrating with an existing codebase, try More Flexible Toolchains.

useRef - Primarily used to allow access directly to an element in the DOM.
useEffect - use for componentWillUnmount, componentDidUnmount. React Hook useEffect causes side effects.
useState, is built on top of useReducer with a very thin layer between them.

useCallback and useMemo. They are both used to memorize, with useCallback, memoizing a function, and use useMemo, doing the same for a value. ... The Hook useCallback caches a function and useMemo caches a value.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization:
In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs
by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

useContext -  That gave us the ability to pass data, config data in our example, down the component tree without prop drilling,
useReducer - gave us a nice way to organize our state management,
useCallback - gave us a nice performance gain by not having all our speaker detail pages have to rerender on every button click of any speaker,
useMemo - to cache some data on our client, saving some compute time on our app and hopefully making it more responsive in the process.



https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html
Rules of Hooks:
Only Call Hooks at the Top Level
Only Call Hooks from React Functions


ESLint Plugin
npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev
// Your ESLint configuration
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error", // Checks rules of Hooks
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn" // Checks effect dependencies
  }
}


Why do we use the new set of hooks:
1. This is going to be our starting point to learn the next four React Hooks, useContext, useReducer, useCallback, and useMemo.
You may be thinking, why bother? Everything works. Are those Hooks just wasting my time?
No, there are two primary things we're going after with these new Hooks. One is performance.
That is, now even though you don't see it, each time we favor a speaker, all the other speakers get rerendered with JavaScript,
meaning that if we had hundreds of speakers, your users of lower power laptops might find their fans coming on and
some ugly unresponsiveness in the browser.

2. we will add some configuration options to our app.js, such that we can enable program features,
including showing the Saturday/Sunday selection checkboxes, as well as optionally displaying the sign-me-up-for-more- information textbox.

3. Not only that, using these new Hooks gives you the opportunity to just do better, more reliable programming because they give a richer set of features.


https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html
you would've passed properties around your components up and down complex component trees. It was ugly.
It led to the design pattern commonly used known as prop drilling, and also to HOC, higher-order components,
to basically use class inheritance as a way to pass data around, equally ugly and troublesome.


https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html


React Hooks only available in React Functional Components.
React Hooks can manage state and lifecycle events.
